# Deployment Plan for Softphone Calling Functionality

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to implement and deploy the voice calling functionality for the Softphone application using Twilio. The implementation will focus on:

1. Setting up the Express server to handle Twilio voice integration
2. Configuring TwiML apps automatically when users enter Twilio credentials
3. Deploying the server to Railway
4. Testing the implementation

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Server Setup
- Modify the existing Express server to support voice calling
- Add endpoints for:
  - Token generation for browser-based calling
  - TwiML app configuration
  - Voice webhooks for inbound and outbound calls
  - Call status updates

### 2. Railway Deployment Preparation
- Ensure all dependencies are properly listed in package.json
- Configure environment variables for Railway
- Set up a Procfile (already exists)

### 3. Git Workflow
- Create a new branch called `feature/voice-calling`
- Implement all changes on this branch
- Do not merge to main branch

### 4. Testing Plan
- Test endpoints using curl commands
- Test UI integration
- Verify TwiML app configuration in Twilio dashboard

## Required Endpoints

1. **Token Generation**: `/api/token`
   - Generates Twilio Client tokens for browser-based calling

2. **TwiML App Configuration**: `/api/configure-twiml-app`
   - Creates or updates TwiML apps in Twilio

3. **Voice Webhooks**:
   - Outbound calls: `/api/voice/outbound`
   - Inbound calls: `/api/voice/inbound`
   - Call status: `/api/voice/status`

## Testing Success Criteria
1. User can enter Twilio credentials in the UI
2. TwiML app is automatically created/updated in Twilio
3. Voice configuration is set up for Twilio numbers
4. Outbound calls can be initiated from the browser
5. Inbound calls are properly routed

## Timeline
1. Server implementation: 1-2 days
2. Testing and debugging: 1 day
3. Railway deployment: 1 day

## Resources Required
- Twilio account with voice capabilities
- Railway account for deployment
- Test phone numbers for calling tests
