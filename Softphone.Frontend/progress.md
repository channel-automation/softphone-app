## Integration Details
- **Backend URL**: https://backend-production-3d08.up.railway.app
- **Token Endpoint**: https://backend-production-3d08.up.railway.app/api/voice/token

## Testing Notes
To test the integration:
1. Configure a workspace with valid Twilio credentials
2. Configure the webhook URLs in Twilio phone number settings
3. Make a test call using the dialer
4. Verify that the call is routed through the correct Twilio account
5. Test incoming calls by using the Twilio API to initiate a call to your Twilio number
