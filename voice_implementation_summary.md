# Voice Calling Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've implemented voice calling functionality for the Softphone application using Twilio. This implementation focuses on:

1. Setting up the Express server to handle Twilio voice integration
2. Automating TwiML app configuration when users enter Twilio credentials
3. Preparing the server for Railway deployment
4. Creating testing tools to verify the implementation

## Implementation Details

### 1. Server Structure

- **Express Server**: The main server is in `index.js` with routes organized in separate files
- **Voice Routes**: All voice-related endpoints are in `src/routes/voice.js`
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time updates for call status are handled via Socket.IO

### 2. Key Endpoints

- **Configuration**: `/api/configure-twilio` - Saves Twilio credentials and configures TwiML app
- **Token Generation**: `/api/voice/token` - Generates Twilio Client tokens for browser-based calling
- **Voice Webhooks**:
  - `/api/voice/outbound` - Handles outbound calls
  - `/api/voice/inbound` - Handles inbound calls
  - `/api/voice/status` - Tracks call status

### 3. Database Integration

- Twilio credentials are stored in the workspace table
- TwiML app SID is saved to enable token generation
- Phone numbers are linked to the TwiML app for voice capabilities

## Testing Instructions

### Local Testing

1. Start the server locally:
   ```
   cd Softphone.Frontend/backend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Run the test script:
   ```
   ./test.sh
   ```
   This will test:
   - Twilio configuration
   - Token generation
   - TwiML generation for outbound calls

### Testing with the UI

1. Open the Softphone application
2. Navigate to the Configuration screen
3. Enter Twilio credentials (Account SID, Auth Token, API Key)
4. Save the configuration
5. Verify in the Twilio console that:
   - A TwiML app has been created/updated
   - Phone numbers are configured for voice

### Testing Outbound Calls

1. Open the dialer in the Softphone UI
2. Enter a phone number
3. Click the call button
4. Verify that the call connects

### Testing Inbound Calls

1. Call one of the Twilio numbers associated with your workspace
2. Verify that the call is routed to the browser

## Railway Deployment

1. Create a new project in Railway
2. Connect your GitHub repository (feature/voice-calling branch)
3. Set the required environment variables:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`
   - `BASE_URL` (the URL of your Railway deployment)
4. Railway will automatically deploy your application

## Curl Commands for Testing

Test the configuration endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/configure-twilio \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "workspaceId": "120",
    "accountSid": "YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID",
    "authToken": "YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN",
    "apiKey": "YOUR_CHANNEL_AUTOMATION_API_KEY"
  }'
```

Generate a token:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/voice/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "workspaceId": "120",
    "identity": "agent01"
  }'
```

Test outbound call TwiML:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/voice/outbound \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "To": "+1234567890",
    "From": "+12624130047",
    "WorkspaceId": "120"
  }'
```
